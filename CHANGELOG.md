## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added a regression testsuite to protect us against unintended changes in the
  generated output.  Important for contributors:  If the changes _are_ intended,
  you can use `cargo insta review` to sign off on the changes and add them as part
  of your contribution ([#37]).
  
### Changed
- Updated most dependencies.
- Updated `xmltree` to version `0.10`.

[#37]: https://github.com/Rahix/atdf2svd/pull/37


## [0.3.3] - 2022-10-23
### Added
- Added an optional patch for removing common prefixes from register names.  It
  can be enabled with the `--auto-patches remove_register_common_prefix`
  commandline option ([#33]).
- Added translation of the ATDF architecture and series into appropriate SVD
  fields ([#32]).

### Changed
- Internally switched to using [`svd-rs`] instead of hand-rolling the SVD file
  ([#34]).

### Fixed
- Fixed generation of empty enumerated values ([#35]).

[`svd-rs`]: https://crates.io/crates/svd-rs

[#35]: https://github.com/Rahix/atdf2svd/pull/35


## [0.3.2] - 2022-09-20
### Changed
- Errors during interrupt generation have been converted to warnings.  This
  means you can generate an SVD even without interrupts ([#31]).
- Updated dependencies.

[#31]: https://github.com/Rahix/atdf2svd/pull/31


## [0.3.1] - 2021-08-01
### Fixed
- Added missing `<addressBlock>` elements to be more in line with the SVD spec
  ([#26]).
- Fixed a few SVDConv errors and warnings ([#28]).

[#28]: https://github.com/Rahix/atdf2svd/pull/28



## [0.3.0] - 2021-03-18
### Fixed
- Fixed bitmask calculation not being correct for register sizes greater than
  1 byte ([#21]).
- Fixed use of the wrong attribute for access mode. `rw` should be used instead
  of `ocd-rw` ([#24]).

[#24]: https://github.com/Rahix/atdf2svd/pull/24


## [0.2.0] - 2020-11-25
### Added
- `--version` commandline argument.
- Support for write-only register fields ([#9]).
- Support for newer AVR MCUs in the `signals_to_port_fields` patch ([#10]).

### Changed
- Fall back to module caption if instance caption is missing ([#15]).
- Improved naming of interrupts for newer AVR MCUs ([#19]).
- When multiple interrupts with the same vector exist, their names are merged
  into a single interrupt definition ([#20]).

### Fixed
- Properly handle empty `caption` attribute for enumerated values ([#12]).
- Fixed empty `caption` for peripherals ([`3f0003c75350`]).
- Enumerated values which don't actually fit into a field are now dropped with
  a warning ([#14]).

## [0.1.4] - 2020-10-02
### Changed
- Switch to gumdrop instead of structopt ([`6b21b7ac3f91`]).

### Fixed

## [0.1.3] - 2020-07-26
### Fixed
- Allow missing caption for peripherals.
- Make sure child nodes in register-group have the correct name.
- Only parse `interrupt` children and ignore any other named ones.
- Allow `signals_to_port_fields` patch to fail.
